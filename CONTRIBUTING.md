## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 9.0.0
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/designers.git
   cd designers
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the code standards below
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Build to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Working with Packages

- **Core package** (`packages/core`): Contains the main design system logic
- **CLI package** (`packages/cli`): The `npx designers init` command
- **React package** (`packages/react`): React-specific components and hooks
- **Animations package** (`packages/animations`): Animation utilities
- **Integrations package** (`packages/integrations`): UI library integrations
- **Tailwind plugin** (`packages/tailwind-plugin`): Tailwind CSS integration

## Code Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Export types for public APIs

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting (configured in `.prettierrc`)
- Use ESLint for linting (configured in `.eslintrc.js`)
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components and classes
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update README files when adding new features
- Include examples in documentation

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests for specific package
npm run test --filter=@designers/core
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Test TypeScript types when applicable

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Create a changeset** (for version bumps)
   ```bash
   npm run changeset
   ```

3. **Push your branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Include a detailed description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Request review from maintainers

## Release Process

This project uses Changesets for version management:

1. **Create changesets** for your changes:
   ```bash
   npm run changeset
   ```

2. **Version packages** (maintainers only):
   ```bash
   npm run version-packages
   ```

3. **Release** (maintainers only):
   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```
